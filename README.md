Just a standard Java/Gradle console application with junit/mockito/hamcrest for testing

This should simple give a starting point to start a console application with gradle and can be extended to
pretty much anywhere from here. I happen to like the combination of hamcrest/junit/mockito to write
tests that are fast to write and easy to understand.
